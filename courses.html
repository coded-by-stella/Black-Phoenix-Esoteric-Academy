  <h1 class="page-title">Which Witch Are You?<br/>The 9 Paths to Begin Walking Your Magic</h1>
  <p class="page-slogan">Rise, learn and master your magic.</p>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Not all witches practice in the same way. The 9 introductory paths of the Black Phoenix Esoteric Academy
    are designed for beginners who feel the call of magic and want to understand where they resonate the most
    before choosing a deeper, professional path.
  </p>

  <p class="intro-note">
    These are short, structured journeys that help you understand what kind of witch you are, build solid and safe foundations
    and grow in awareness, so you can access the Professional Path of the 7 Pillars
    or practice your magic for yourself in a more grounded way.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">How the 9 Paths Work</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    Each path is designed for complete or almost-complete beginners. It includes theoretical lessons, simple exercises
    and basic rituals, and is based on the content of the 7 Pillars in a guided and simplified format.
  </p>
  <p class="intro-note">
    At the end of the path, you will receive a participation certificate dedicated to the type of witch you explored
    and a continuity map that shows you which Pillars to follow next if you want to enter the
    professional program of the Black Phoenix Esoteric Academy.
