  <!-- HOW YOU STUDY -->
  <section class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
      <h1 class="hero-title">How you study: flexible, structured and fully guided.</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h4 class="card-title">One lesson per week, with sacred pauses</h4>
      <p>
        All journeys follow the recommended rhythm of <strong>one lesson per week</strong> during active periods,
        so you can integrate without rushing and stay grounded in everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <strong>Pillar</strong> is made of <strong>6 connected lessons</strong>.
        Each <strong>full Path</strong> includes <strong>7 Pillars</strong>, for a total of <strong>42 lessons</strong>.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h4 class="card-title">Live lessons, recordings or both</h4>
      <p>
        Lessons can be <strong>live</strong>, <strong>pre-recorded</strong> or
        <strong>live with replay available</strong>.
        The weekly lesson is always guaranteed during active calendar periods,
        even if the teacher is travelling or busy.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h4 class="card-title">PDF materials (only when they truly help)</h4>
      <p>
        Some lessons include <strong>PDF handouts</strong> with theory, rituals and further study.
        Others focus only on guided practice, intuitive exercises or personal notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials are not guaranteed for every single lesson; they are offered when the topic
        really benefits from tables, diagrams or supporting texts.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h4 class="card-title">Quizzes, exams and resits</h4>
      <p>
        Along the way you will meet <strong>short self-assessment quizzes</strong> to see what you have integrated
        and which parts you want to review.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <strong>Pillar</strong>, each <strong>Path of study</strong> and the
        <strong>complete 5-Path curriculum</strong> have a final exam.
        If you do not pass an exam you can <strong>retake it once for free</strong>.
        From the third attempt onwards there is a <strong>€ 27</strong> fee for each new session.

    </div>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h4 class="card-title">1. Single class</h4>
      <p>
        A <strong>Single class</strong> is one standalone lesson from the official curriculum.
        It focuses on a specific topic, such as a ritual, a technique, a practical aspect or devotional work,
        and includes the lesson, possible PDFs and a short final quiz.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end you receive a <strong>Black Phoenix Esoteric Academy Certificate of Attendance</strong>
        for that single class. This is not a professional diploma.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can choose to attend <strong>only a few classes</strong> or,
        over time, complete all the classes that form a Pillar or a Path:
        single lessons <strong>add up</strong> and later allow you to take the exam
        and obtain the corresponding certificate.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h4 class="card-title">2. Pillar (6 lessons)</h4>
      <p>
        A <strong>Pillar</strong> is a block of <strong>6 connected lessons</strong> on a specific sub-topic
        (for example protection, esoteric botanicals, rituals, shadow work, lunar work, elements…).
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the Pillar, after the required quizzes, you receive a
        <strong>Black Phoenix Esoteric Academy Pillar Completion Certificate</strong>.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h4 class="card-title">3. Path of study (7 Pillars · 42 lessons)</h4>
      <p>
        A <strong>Path of study</strong> is a structured curriculum made of <strong>7 Pillars</strong>,
        for a total of <strong>42 lessons</strong> fully dedicated to a specific stream of practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        All students begin with the <strong>Path of the Foundations of Occult Esoteric Art</strong>,
        then they can choose one or more specialization Paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of each Path, after the final exam, you receive a
        <strong>Path Completion Certificate</strong>.  
        Some Paths give access to <strong>IAOTH certifications</strong>, as explained below.
      </p>

      <h4 class="card-title">International Diploma “Holistic Esoteric Operator (IAOTH Accredited)”</h4>

      </p>

      <p>

        In several European countries, such as Italy, this activity may fall under
        <strong>Law 4/2013</strong> on non-regulated professions, in compliance with national and regional laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Diploma does not qualify you for medical or psychological practice:
        it trains practitioners in the <strong>spiritual, energetic, esoteric and occult arts</strong>,
        rooted in ethics, responsibility and ancient tradition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>IAOTH</strong> recognition applies only to
